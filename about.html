            <h1 class="text-center text-primary">Beats</h1>
            <p class="aboutus-content text-white">
                1:- Beats Electronics LLC (also known as Beats by Dr. Dre, or simply Beats by Dre) is a subsidiary of
                Apple Inc. that produces audio products. Headquartered in Culver City, California,[5][third-party source
                needed] the company was founded by music producer and rapper Dr. Dre and Interscope Records
                co-founder[6][full citation needed] Jimmy Iovine. <br> <br>
                2:- The subsidiary's product line is primarily focused on headphones and speakers. The company's original
                product line was manufactured in partnership with the AV equipment company Monster Cable Products.
                Following the end of its contract with the company, Beats took further development of its products
                in-house. In 2014, the company expanded into the online music market with the launch of a
                subscription-based streaming service, Beats Music. <br>
                <br>
                3:- In 2011, NPD Group reported that Beats' market share was 64% in the U.S. for headphones priced higher
                than $100, and the brand was valued at $1 billion in September 2013.[7][8]
                <br><br>
                4:- For a period, the company was majority-owned by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC. The company reduced
                its stake to 25% in 2012, and sold its remaining stake back to the company in 2013. Concurrently,
                Carlyle Group replaced HTC as a minority shareholder, alongside Dr. Dre and Iovine in late 2013. On
                August 1, 2014, Apple acquired Beats for $3 billion in a cash and stock deal, the largest acquisition in
                Apple's history.<br> <br>
            <h5>Beats Audio</h5>
            The company has also licensed the Beats brand, under the name Beats Audio (rendered beats audio), and
            technology to other manufacturers. In 2009, HP began to offer personal computers equipped with Beats Audio
            systems, beginning with its HP Envy line.[54] The system features a software equalizer with a preset that HP
            marketed as being optimized for higher quality sound output.[55] Beats Electronics ceased its partnership
            with HP following its purchase by Apple Inc.; HP subsequently entered into a similar agreement with Bang &
            Olufsen.[56] <br> <br>
            <h5>Beats Music</h5>
            8 Main article: Beats Music
            On July 2, 2012, Beats announced it had acquired the online music service MOG, in a purchase reported to
            have been between $10 million and $16 million. Beats stated that the acquisition was part of the company's
            goal to develop a "truly end-to-end music experience". The acquisition did not include the company's blog
            and advertising network, the MOG Music Network,[63][64] which was sold in a separate transaction to the
            broadcasting company Townsquare Media in August 2012.[65]

            While MOG indicated that it would continue to operate independently with no immediate change in service,[64]
            Beats subsequently announced a new subscription-based online music service, known as Beats Music, which
            launched in January 2014. In comparison to its competitors, such as Spotify and Google Play Music, the
            service emphasizes recommendations by music professionals alongside algorithmic recommendations.[27][66] MOG
            was shut down on May 31, 2014, and existing users were directed to Beats Music.[67] Beats Music was in turn
            replaced by Apple Music in June 2015; the service also incorporates a Beats-branded online radio station,
            Beats 1.[38][39] <br> <br>
